# Solving-System-of-Linear-Equations
Gaussian elimination is used to solve system of linear equations

This program solves Ax = b, where A is an nxn square matrix.

This program gets two command line arguments. First one is the name of the file that contains A matrix. The second argument is the name of the file that contains b vector.  

If A matrix is singular there will be a message in command prompt, otherwise, solutions will be written in "Solutions.txt" in the folder.

The first input A.txt file should be like:

3.14 1.59 2.65 3.58
9.79 3.23 8.46 2.64
3.38 3.27 9.50 2.88
4.19 7.16 9.39 9.37


The second input b.txt file should be like:

5.10
5.82
0.97
4.94
